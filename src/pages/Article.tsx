            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Air travel can be stressful, and one of the most frustrating experiences for passengers is arriving at the airport only to find out their bag exceeds airline size limits. Each airline has specific baggage policies, and failing to meet them could mean extra fees, last-minute baggage check-ins, or even having to leave items behind.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              To avoid these hassles, it's essential to measure your luggage properly and use a luggage size checker before heading to the airport.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Common Airline Requirements for Luggage Sizes</h2>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              While there are no universal luggage size rules, most airlines follow standard dimensions for carry-on and checked baggage. Here's a general guide:
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Carry-On Luggage Size Restrictions</h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Most major airlines adhere to similar carry-on size limits, typically:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>22 x 14 x 9 inches (56 x 36 x 23 cm) including wheels and handles.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              However, budget airlines like Ryanair, Spirit Airlines, and Wizz Air tend to have stricter rules, often allowing smaller carry-on bags to encourage passengers to pay for checked luggage.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              It is always best to check your airline's official baggage policy before flying. You can find this information on their websites, such as:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>American Airlines Baggage Policy</li>
              <li>Ryanair Cabin Bags Guide</li>
              <li>Emirates Baggage Allowance</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Checked Baggage Size & Weight Limits</h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              For checked luggage, airlines typically allow standard suitcase dimensions of:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>62 linear inches (158 cm) (total of height + width + depth).</li>
              <li>Weight limit: 50 lbs (23 kg) for economy class, or up to 70 lbs (32 kg) for business/first class.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Some airlines charge overweight baggage fees, which can range from $50 to $200 per bag, depending on weight.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">How to Measure Your Luggage Correctly</h2>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Using a luggage size checker is the best way to ensure your bag meets airline regulations. Here's how to measure your suitcase properly:
            </p>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Include Wheels and Handles</h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Many travelers make the mistake of measuring only the main compartment of their suitcase. Always measure from the top of the handle to the bottom of the wheels.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Measure the Widest Points</h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Instead of measuring from edge to edge, place a tape measure across the widest part of your bag.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Use a Digital Luggage Scale</h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              To avoid overweight baggage fees, use a portable luggage scale to weigh your suitcase before arriving at the airport.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Consider Soft-Sided vs. Hard-Sided Bags</h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Soft suitcases can expand when packed full, potentially pushing them over the size limit. Hard-shell suitcases are less flexible but maintain their dimensions better.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Luggage Size Checker: A Must-Have Travel Tool</h2>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Instead of guessing whether your suitcase will fit airline requirements, use an online luggage size checker like SizeMyBag to quickly verify dimensions. These tools allow you to:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Compare baggage size limits across multiple airlines.</li>
              <li>Check both carry-on and checked bag allowances.</li>
              <li>Get direct links to airline baggage policies.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Some airports now offer baggage sizers near check-in areas, but it's always better to check before leaving home.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Avoid Extra Fees & Travel Stress</h2>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Not following airline baggage policies can result in unexpected expenses and last-minute headaches. To avoid problems:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Measure your bag before leaving home.</li>
              <li>Use a luggage size checker for airline-specific rules.</li>
              <li>Weigh your suitcase to prevent overweight baggage fees.</li>
              <li>Check your airline's official website for the latest updates.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              By preparing ahead, you can save money, avoid stress, and travel with confidence knowing your luggage meets all size requirements.
            </p>
