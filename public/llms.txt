## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do wheels and handles count in luggage measurements?
Yes, most airlines include wheels and handles in your total baggage dimensions. Always measure from the bottom of wheels to the top of handles.

### What's the standard carry-on size for airlines?
Typically 22 x 14 x 9 inches (56 x 36 x 23 cm), but it varies significantly by airline. Budget carriers often have stricter limits like 40 x 20 x 25 cm.

### What happens if my bag is too big?
You may be charged an oversized baggage fee (often $50-$100+) or be required to check your bag at the gate.

### Is carry-on size the same for international flights?
No. International flights, especially on budget airlines, often have stricter carry-on size limits. Always verify before you fly.

### How do I measure my luggage correctly?
1. Place luggage upright on a flat surface
2. Measure height from floor to top (including wheels/handles)
3. Measure width side to side at widest point
4. Measure depth front to back (including pockets)
