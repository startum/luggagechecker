# SizeMyBag Frequently Asked Questions

## Measurement Questions

### Do wheels and handles count in luggage measurements?

**Yes**, almost all airlines include wheels and handles in your total baggage dimensions. When measuring your luggage:

- Measure from the bottom of the wheels to the top of fully extended handles
- Include any external pockets or protrusions in your depth measurement
- Some airlines are stricter than others about enforcement

### How do I measure my luggage correctly?

Follow these five steps:

1. **Place luggage upright** on a flat, hard surface
2. **Extend all handles** fully to their maximum height
3. **Measure HEIGHT** from the floor to the highest point (usually the extended handle)
4. **Measure WIDTH** at the widest point from side to side
5. **Measure DEPTH** from front to back, including any external pockets

Use a measuring tape for accuracy. For weight, use a luggage scale or bathroom scale.

### Should I measure my bag empty or packed?

- **Dimensions**: Measure with the bag empty (the structure doesn't change significantly)
- **Weight**: Measure with the bag fully packed as you would travel

### What's the standard carry-on size for airlines?

There is no universal standard. Common limits are:

| Region | Typical Size |
|--------|--------------|
| US carriers | 56 x 36 x 23 cm (22 x 14 x 9 in) |
| European carriers | 55 x 40 x 23 cm |
| Budget airlines | 40-45 cm height max |
| Asian carriers | 56 x 36 x 23 cm, 7 kg weight |

**Always check your specific airline** as policies vary significantly.

## Policy Questions

### What happens if my bag is too big?

Consequences vary by airline but may include:

- **Gate check requirement**: You must check the bag (often at higher fees)
- **Oversized fees**: $50-$100+ depending on the airline
- **Denied boarding**: Until the bag situation is resolved
- **Forced removal**: Items may need to be removed to fit size requirements

Budget airlines like Ryanair and Spirit are particularly strict about enforcement.

### Is carry-on size the same for international flights?

**No.** Baggage policies can differ:

- Between domestic and international routes
- Between different international destinations
- Based on your fare class (economy vs. business)
- Based on your frequent flyer status

European and Asian budget carriers often have stricter limits than North American airlines.

### Do personal items count as carry-on?

Most airlines allow:

- **One carry-on bag** (overhead bin)
- **One personal item** (under seat)

Personal item limits are typically smaller: around 40 x 30 x 15 cm (16 x 12 x 6 in). Examples include:

- Purse or small handbag
- Laptop bag or briefcase
- Small backpack

Some budget airlines (Spirit, Frontier, Ryanair non-priority) only include a personal item for free.

### Why do budget airlines have stricter limits?

Budget carriers have stricter baggage policies because:

1. **Revenue generation**: Baggage fees are a significant income source
2. **Faster boarding**: Smaller bags speed up the boarding process
3. **Overhead bin space**: More passengers means less space per person
4. **Lower base fares**: Baggage costs are unbundled from ticket prices

1. **Pack light**: Stay within personal item limits when possible
2. **Pre-purchase online**: Always cheaper than gate fees
3. **Use SizeMyBag**: Verify dimensions before you leave home
4. **Weigh at home**: Don't get caught by weight limits
5. **Airline credit cards**: Many include free checked bags

Check your airline's specific policy before purchasing.
