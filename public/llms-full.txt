## Detailed FAQ

### Measurement Questions

**Q: Do wheels and handles count in luggage measurements?**
A: Yes, almost all airlines include wheels and handles in the total dimensions. Measure from the bottom of wheels to the top of fully extended handles. External pockets also count when measuring depth.

**Q: How do I measure my luggage correctly?**
A: Follow these steps:
1. Place your luggage upright on a flat, hard surface
2. Extend all handles fully
3. Measure HEIGHT from floor to highest point (top of handle)
4. Measure WIDTH at the widest point (side to side)
5. Measure DEPTH from front to back including any pockets or protrusions
6. Weigh your bag fully packed on a reliable scale

**Q: Should I measure with the bag empty or packed?**
A: Measure dimensions with the bag empty (structure doesn't change). Measure weight with the bag fully packed as you would travel.

**Q: What's the standard carry-on size?**
A: There is no universal standard. However, common limits are:
- US carriers: 56 x 36 x 23 cm (22 x 14 x 9 in)
- European carriers: 55 x 40 x 23 cm
- Budget airlines: Often smaller, 40-45 cm height max
Always check your specific airline before traveling.

### Policy Questions

**Q: What happens if my bag is too big?**
A: Consequences vary by airline:
- You may need to check the bag (fees often $30-$75+)
- Gate-checked bags may incur higher fees ($50-$100+)
- Some airlines refuse boarding until bag is checked
- Items may need to be removed to fit

**Q: Is carry-on size the same for international flights?**
A: No. Policies can differ even within the same airline based on route. International flights, especially on budget carriers, often have stricter limits. Always verify for your specific route.

**Q: Do personal items count as carry-on?**
A: Most airlines allow one carry-on plus one personal item (purse, laptop bag, etc.). Personal items must fit under the seat. Size limits for personal items vary: typically 40 x 30 x 15 cm.

**Q: Why do budget airlines have stricter limits?**
A: Budget carriers earn revenue from baggage fees and maximize passengers per flight. Stricter limits enable more efficient boarding and overhead bin usage.

### Fee Questions

**Q: How much do oversized bag fees cost?**
A: Fees vary widely:
- US carriers: $30-$50 per checked bag, $100+ if oversized
- European budget: €25-€60 for carry-on, €40-€80 for checked
- Gate fees are typically 2x online booking fees

**Q: Can I avoid baggage fees?**
A: Tips to avoid fees:
- Pack light to stay within personal item limits
- Pre-purchase baggage online (cheaper than gate fees)
- Use SizeMyBag to verify dimensions before departure
- Consider airline credit cards (often include free bags)
